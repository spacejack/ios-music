# iOS Music Guides

This is a series of guides for things I've repeatedly needed to look up and sometimes just want a quick reference for. Guides will be added as I think of them.

1. [A guide to using digital pianos/keyboard controllers with iOS](https://spacejack.github.io/ios-piano/)
2. [(Free) Sidechain Compression in AUM with RoughRider3](./aum-sidechain.md)
